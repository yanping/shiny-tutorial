## Sharing Apps to Run Locally

如果你写了自己的shiny应用，你可以分派你的应用给其它人以使其在自己的电脑上运行该应用&mdash;他们可以用一条R命令来下载和运行Shiny应用，这要求他们在自己的电脑上安装了R和Shiny包。

如果你想要让你的Shiny应用可以通过网页访问，这样其它用户只需要通过浏览器就可以访问，查看<a href="#deployment-web">基于Web布署Shiny应用</a>

Here are some ways to deliver Shiny apps to run locally:

### Gist

One easy way is to put your code on [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com), a code pasteboard service from [GitHub](https://github.com/). Both server.R and ui.R must be included in the same gist, and you must use their proper filenames. See [https://gist.github.com/3239667](https://gist.github.com/3239667) for an example.

Your recipient must have R and the Shiny package installed, and then running the app is as easy as entering the following command:

<pre><code class="r">shiny::runGist('3239667')</code></pre>

In place of `'3239667'` you will use your gist's ID; or, you can use the entire URL of the gist (e.g. `'https://gist.github.com/3239667'`).

#### Pros
* Source code is easily visible by recipient (if desired)
* Easy to run (for R users)
* Easy to post and update

#### Cons
* Code is published to a third-party server


### GitHub repository

If your project is stored in a git repository on GitHub, then others can download and run your app directly. An example repository is at [https://github.com/rstudio/shiny_example](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny_example). The following command will download and run the application:

<pre><code class="r">shiny::runGitHub('shiny_example', 'rstudio')</code></pre>

In this example, the GitHub account is `'rstudio'` and the repository is `'shiny_example'`; you will need to replace them with your account and repository name.

#### Pros
* Source code is easily visible by recipient (if desired)
* Easy to run (for R users)
* Very easy to update if you already use GitHub for your project
* Git-savvy users can clone and fork your repository

#### Cons
* Developer must know how to use git and GitHub
* Code is hosted by a third-party server


### Zip File, delivered over the web

If you store a zip or tar file of your project on a web or FTP server, users can download and run it with a command like this:

<pre><code class="r">runUrl('https://github.com/rstudio/shiny_example/archive/master.zip')</code></pre>

The URL in this case is a zip file that happens to be stored on GitHub; replace it with the URL to your zip file.

#### Pros
* Only requires a web server for delivery

#### Cons
* To view the source, recipient must first download and unzip it


### Zip File, copied to recipient's computer

Another way is to simply zip up your project directory and send it to your recipient(s), where they can unzip the file and run it the same way you do (`shiny::runApp`).

#### Pros
* Share apps using e-mail, USB flash drive, or any other way you can transfer a file

#### Cons
* Updates to app must be sent manually


### Package

If your Shiny app is useful to a broader audience, it might be worth the effort to turn it into an R package. Put your Shiny application directory under the package's `inst` directory, then create and export a function that contains something like this:

<pre><code class="r">shiny::runApp(system.file('<em>appdir</em>', package='<em>packagename</em>'))</code></pre>

where `appdir` is the name of your app's subdirectory in `inst`, and `packagename` is the name of your package.

#### Pros
* Publishable on CRAN
* Easy to run (for R users)

#### Cons
* More work to set up
* Source code is visible by recipient (if not desired)
